## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.5] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- `[D]` Pin `torch<2.13`. torch 2.13.0 — a fresh resolve inside the previous
  `>=2.8,<3` range — segfaults (`SIGSEGV` in `mps copy_cast_kernel`) when the
  embedder, privacy filter and NSFW classifier touch MPS concurrently, which is
  exactly what a node does while answering its first query. Every new install on
  Apple silicon crashed on its first chat message; nothing before that point
  failed, so boot and control-plane checks all passed first. Reproduced with two
  encode threads plus a pipeline load (exit 139 on 2.13.0, clean on 2.11.0) and
  guarded by the `a8b` check in the `topos-install-qa` skill.

## [1.3.4] — 2026-07-29

- `[S1] [O]` Coverage `spec_version` columns + catalog `JOB_SPEC_VERSIONS`
  (PLAN_NODE_RELEASE_MIGRATIONS M3); writers stamp; anti-join treats NULL as 0.
- `[O]` Upgrade step kinds `canonical_reprocess` / `derived_rebuild` /
  `reembed`; `consent: prompt` → `pending_consent` + `/v1/upgrade/consent`.
- `[O]` Upgrade-matrix CI fixture builder + catch-up runner (M4); seeded-DB
  release smoke; device_info upgrade summary fields for fleet (M5).

## [1.3.3] — 2026-07-29

### Added

- `[S1] [O]` Single migration registry (`MIGRATIONS`), `PRAGMA user_version`
  fast-path, fail-loud schema migrations, pre-migration backup under
  `~/.topos/backups/`, downgrade guard when `user_version` is ahead of this
  build (PLAN_NODE_RELEASE_MIGRATIONS M0–M2).
- `[O]` `scripts/cut_release.py`, `check_release_artifacts.py`,
  `sync_migration_checksums.py`, `RELEASING.md`.
- `[P] [O]` Attention triage: `signal_pin_intent` / `signal_retire_intent`
  control-plane handlers.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-07-29

### Added

- `[S1] [O]` Entity black hole owner controls + turn-level taint.
- `[S1] [O]` Complexity data-page engine (summary / timeline / topics / influence).
- `[O]` App-mode shell contract (attach-don't-double-start, file logs, tray over HTTP).
- `[O]` Unified timeline daily reads; scope-registry sync.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- `[O]` Prioritize UI bootstrap over upgrade reprocess (patch anchor; no
  derived-layer invalidation).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added

- `[S1] [E:attention_triage]` Attention triage (daily 2×2 verdicts, badges/ranks, dashboard).
- `[O]` Negotiable time-signal availability (flex / rhythm / commitments).
- `[S1]` Conversation context tags (work / personal).
- `[O]` Claim verification / fact verdicts; facts-LLM think gating.

## [1.2.7] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- `[O]` Temporal coherence and client-local now for relative dates.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-10

### Changed

- `[E:entities] [D]` NER wordpiece stitcher — re-extract entities + rebuild
  entity graph on upgrade (see manifests.json `1.2.0`).
- `[S1]` Temporal entity graph layers, provenance roles, Louvain neighborhoods.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added

- `[S1] [D]` Dense intelligence upgrade (stats engine, entity spine, fact
  store, incremental clustering, query planner). Anchors the upgrade ladder.
